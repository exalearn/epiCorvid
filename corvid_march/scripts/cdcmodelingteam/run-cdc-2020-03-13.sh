# script for running CDC Modeling Team scenarios on March 13, 2020
# We test combinations of R0, duration of closure, and threshold number
# of cases before schools close.
# After the runs are completed, the model outputs are moved to "results".
# This script will take a long time to run everything on a single core.
# It just runs one simulation at a time.
# Users might want to modify it to take advantage of multi-core systems 
# or clusters.
