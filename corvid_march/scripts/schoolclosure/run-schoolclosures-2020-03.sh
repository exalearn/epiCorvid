#script for generating config files for liberal leave, work from home, total school closure (non-reactive) sweep
#runs combinations of duration of closure, ascertainment of cases, delay of closure after first ascertained case
# After the runs are completed, the model outputs are moved to "results".
# This script will take a long time to run everything on a single core.
# It just runs one simulation at a time.
# Users might want to modify it to take advantage of multi-core systems 
# or clusters.
