Instructions for Corvid, a stochastic coronavirus epidemic simulation model
by Dennis Chao
March 2020

Corvid is an individual-based model that simulates the spread of SARS-CoV-2
in synthetic populations that represent communities in the United States.

Corvid is based on the influenza model FluTE (https://github.com/dlchao/FluTE).

Several parameters were adjusted to adapt the FluTE flu transmission 
to SARS-CoV-2 transmission, such as incubation period, symptomatic fraction,
and viral load trajectories.

This model only supports single-core (unlike FluTE, which had a parallel
computing version), so populations of more than 10,000,000 will probably
not run on a laptop.

We include several scripts that we use for reports in the "scripts"
directory. There are Makefile targets for setting up directories and
running these scripts. When these runs are completed, you should be
able to compile the R Markdown files (*.Rmd) to generate reports
based on these results.

--------------------------
1. Compilation

The source code and Makefile are in the "code" directory.
The Makefile can be used on Linux systems to compile corvid (standard 
simulator) and R0corvid (version of corvid in which only a single index case
is infectious). You can also make "guide", which will compile corvid and
run it in a new directory "corvid-guide" using sample configuration files
for a Seattle-like population. You can then use the R Markdown file
("corvid-guide.Rmd") that parses the outputs from these runs and produces
a document on how to use Corvid.

The source files are:
  epimodel.cpp - model implementation
  corvid.cpp - contains main()
  params.cpp - simulation constants
  epimodelparameters.cpp - code to parse config files
  R0model.cpp - class derived from epimodel.cpp for R0 calculations.  
    Contains main().
  dSFMT.c - SIMD oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (dSFMT) (from 
    http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT)
  bnldev.c - Numerical Recipes in C code for drawing random numbers 
    from the binomial distribution

--------------------------
2. Data files

A set of 3 data files needs to be in the same directory as the 
executable to specify a population for Corvid. The file names consist of
a prefix (e.g., "seattle") followed by a suffix.

*-tracts.dat - Tract populations and locations, from 
http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/cntpop2k.html. The columns in
this comma-delimited file are: state FIPS code, county FIPS code, 
tract FIPS code, tract population, tract longitude, and tract 
latitude.

*-wf.dat - Tract-to-tract workerflow, extracted from stp64.us from 
Census 2000 Special Tabulation Product 64: Census tract of work by 
census tract of residence 2000. For the US-level data. Commutes over 
100 miles were eliminated from the data. The columns in this space-
delimited file are: home state FIPS code, home county FIPS code, home 
tract FIPS code, work state FIPS code, work county FIPS code, work 
tract FIPS code, and number of workers.

*-employment.dat - The number of employed working-age adults and the 
total number of working-age adults, from the Census Summary File 3 
(SF3, Table PCT35). The columns in this space-delimited file are: 
state FIPS code, county FIPS code, tract FIPS code, number of employed
20-64 year olds, and the total number of working-age individuals
(19-64 year olds).

The sample populations, in the corviddata directory, are:

one - a single community of 2000 people.

seattle - metropolitan Seattle, based on the 2000 US Census.

kingcounty - King County (Washington State), based on the 2000 US Census.

la - Los Angeles County.  la-tracts.dat is not from the 2000 Census;
It is based on 2007 PEPS estimates from Walter R. McDonald & 
Associates, Inc. (WRMA) and padded with an additional 776,000 
individuals to represent the estimated undocumented population 
[Flaming et al. Hopeful Workers, Marginal Jobs. 2005].  The other
"la" data files are based on the 2000 US Census.

--------------------------
3. Configuration

A text file with one parameter per line is supplied as the command-line
argument for Corvid to configure a simulation run (e.g., 
"./corvid config-file"). Each line should start with a parameter name and 
the parameter value, separated by a single space.  Parameter values can
be strings (can not include white space), integers, reals, or binary 
(0 or 1).  Square brackets indicate the number of parameters required.
Lines beginning with "#" are ignored. Defaults are generally ok, but most 
configuration files should have a label, datafile, and R0 (or beta).  The 
parameter names are as follows:

label : string
A name that is output in the summary file for the user's convenience (e.g., "simulation1"). With this value, the user can tag output files from specific simulation runs.

datafile : (required) string
The prefix for the input data file names (e.g., one, seattle, la, usa).

logfile : integer
Number that indicates how often, in days, output is written to the Log file. If 0, no Log file is generated. Default is 1 for daily output. 

individualfile : binary
Specifies if an "Individuals" file should be generated. The file will contain one row of simulation-specific data for each individual and can be very large. If 1, file is generated. The default is 0, no file generated even if you specifiy "individualfilename". 

summaryfilename : string
Specify a name for the "Summary" file. The default name is "Summary(n)", where (n) is the number in the run-number file.

logfilename : string
Specify a name for the "Log" file. The default name is "Log(n)", where (n) is the number in the run-number file.

tractfilename : string
Specify a name for the "Tracts" file. The default name is "Tracts(n)", where (n) is the number in the run-number file.

individualfilename : string
Specify a name for the "Individuals" file. The default name is "Individuals(n)", where (n) is the number in the run-number file.

beta : real
Transmission parameter (sometime known as Ptrans). This value is multiplied by the inter-personal contact probability to determine the transmission probability between infected and susceptible persons. Default is 0.1.

R0 : real
Basic reproductive number, which is internally converted to beta. 

symptomaticfraction : real
Fraction of cases who will become symptomatic. This parameter affects the relationship between beta and R0, which is hard-coded into epimodelparameters.cpp assuming the default of 0.5. If you use this option, use beta to set transmissibility, not R0. You should probably not change this parameter.

randomnumberseed : integer
Random number generator seed.

runlength : integer
Number of days the simulation should run. Default is 180. 

preexistingimmunityprotection: real
Those with pre-existing immunity have susceptibility reduced by preexistingimmunityprotection.

preexistingimmunitybyage : real[5]
Vector of 5 values representing the fraction of individuals in each age group with pre-existing immunity. Those with pre-existing immunity have susceptibility reduced by preexistingimmunitylevel.

defaultVESbyage : real[5]
Vector of 5 values representing the "VE_S" of individuals in each age group. This value reduces the susceptibility of the entire age group. A value of 0 indicates that the age group is fully susceptible and 1 indicates that it is completely immune. The default value is 0.

prestrategy : string
Vaccination strategy before the epidemic occurs. Can take one of the following four values, none, prevaccinate, or primeboostsame. prevaccinate vaccinates a fraction of the population (with 2 doses if required). The primeboostrandom option will give a percentage of the population one shot before the epidemic then may or may not boost those same persons after the epidemic has started. Persons vaccinated after the epidemic has started will be selected at random. In contrast, primeboostsame will boost the same persons after the epidemic that were primed before the epidemic. Default is none.

reactivestrategy : string 
Vaccination strategy for when the epidemic is detected. Can take one of the following three values, none, tract, or mass. The tract option will vaccinate persons in a specific tract once the threshold (i.e., responsethreshold variable) is met. The mass option will vaccinate all persons in all tracts once the threshold is met. Default is none.

vaccinationfraction : real, scalar
Fraction of people to vaccinate if a vaccination strategy is selected. Default is 0.7.

vaccinepriorities : integer[13]
A vector of 13 numbers, representing the vaccine priority for the  13 categories of individuals.  A value of 1 indicates highest priority, 2 is the next-highest priority, etc. 0 indicates that this category is not prioritized to get vaccine. Default is "1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1" (everyone has the same priority). Individuals of lower priority only get vaccine when those with higher do not need any. If a high priority individual is primed, lower priority persons can get vaccine until the high-priority person needs the boost. The categories, in order, are: essential workforce, pregnant women, family members of infants, high risk preschoolers, high risk school-age children, high risk young adults, high risk older adults, high risk elderly, all preschoolers, all school-age children, all young adults, all older adults, all elderly. For example, to have individuals of all ages get the same priority, we set all age-specific priorities to the same value: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1. to give adults lower priority we can do: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 2.

vaccinepriorities2, prioritychangetime - parameters for changing vaccinepriorities in the middle of an epidemic. These parameters might not be supported in future releases.

antiviraldoses : integer, scalar
Number of antiviral courses available at the beginning of the simulation. A single course is defined as 10 pills per person. Default is infinite.
        
vaccinedoses : integer[2]
The vaccine ID followed by the number of vaccine doses available at the beginning of the simulation. A dose is defined as one shot per person. If the vaccine is a split-dose, (i.e., prime and boost), this variable must be twice the total number of doses. To specify 2,000,000 doses of vaccine 0, one would enter 0 2000000. Default is infinite.

vaccineproduction : integer[runlength+1]
Vaccine ID followed by the number of vaccine doses that become available each day during the response. For example, a vector of 1 100 300 500 600 ... would indicate 100 doses of vaccine 1 to become available of day 1 or the response, 300 on day 2, etc. for up to the number of days specified in runlength. The default is 0 (additional vaccine is not produced during the simulation).

antiviraldosesdaily : integer
Number of antiviral courses that can be delivered daily by available resources. Default is no restrictions, or unlimited ability to deliver.

vaccinedosesdaily : integer
Number of vaccinations that can be administered daily by available resources. Default is no restrictions (all available vaccine is administered each day).

vaccinedata : integer, real[3], real[6], bool
Total of 11 values indicating the vaccine id, vaccine efficacy and administration policies for each vaccine. The vaccine efficacy parameters (VE) should be between 0 (no efficacy) and 1 (complete efficacy). The administration policy values are the fraction of the age groups (infant, pre-school age, school-age, adult, elderly) and pregnant women who are restricted from getting the vaccine. The simulation randomly assigns this fraction of the individuals in these groups to be restricted. The default is 0 (none restricted), while 1 indicates that 100% of individuals in this class are restricted. Values must be entered in the following order:
      integer, Numeric ID for the vaccine, starting from 0.
      real, VE_S (the vaccine efficacy for susceptibility),
      real, VE_I (the vaccine efficacy for infectiousness),
      real, VE_P (the vaccine efficacy for illness given infection),
      real, Fraction of infants (age <6months) restricted from getting the vaccine. 
      real, Fraction of pre-school age children (ages 0-4) restricted from getting the vaccine. 
      real, Fraction of school age children (ages 5-18) restricted from getting the vaccine. 
      real, Fraction of young adults (ages 19-29) restricted from getting the vaccine. 
      real, Fraction of older adults (ages 30-64) restricted from getting the vaccine. 
      real, Fraction of elderly (ages 65+) restricted from getting the vaccine.
      bool, Pregnant adults restricted from getting the vaccine. 
An example of specifying multiple vaccines:
vaccinedata 0 0.4 0.5 0.83 1 0.2 0.2 1 1 1 1
vaccinedata 1 0.4 0.4 0.67 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
Here vaccine 0 could be a live vaccine for children and vaccine 1 could be administered to anyone. Note that vaccine 0 has 0.2 for the child restrictions, which means that 20% of children (chosen at random) are not eligible.

vaccinebuildup : integer, integer, real[29]
Total of 31 values. The first value is the vaccine numeric ID, the second is the day that the boost should be given. The remaining 29 values are the vaccine efficacy over the 29 days after the vaccine is given.
      integer, Numeric ID for the vaccine. First vaccine must start at 0. 
      integer, Minimum number of days between the prime and boost ranging from 0 to 28. Default is 0, no boost. 
      reals, 29 values describing the vaccine efficacy buildup, ranging from 0 to 1. The value on the last day should be 1. The default is a one-dose vaccine that reaches maximum efficacy in two weeks.

vaccineefficacybyage : real[5]
Vector of 5 values representing the relative vaccine efficacy for each age group. Age groups are, in order: pre-school (0-4 years), school age children (5-18 years), young adults (19-29 years), older adults (30-64 years), and elderly (65+ years). Values can range from 0=no efficacy to 1-full efficacy. The default is 1, full efficacy, for all age groups. For example, "1 1 1 1 0.6" would make vaccines only 60% as effective in the elderly as everyone else. The same settings are used for all vaccines. 

AVEs : real
Antiviral vaccine efficacy for susceptibility (VE_S). Default is 0.3. 

AVEi : real
Antiviral vaccine efficacy for infectiousness (VE_I). Default is 0.62 

AVEp : real
Antiviral vaccine efficacy for illness given infection (VE_P). Default is 0.6.

responsethreshold : real
Fraction of the population ascertained that results in initiating reactive strategies. Reactive strategies include vaccinations, deploying antivirals, and non-pharmaceutical interventions like liberal leave. For example, 0.01 would set this trigger at 1% of the population. The default is 0.0 which initiates reactive strategies after the first person is ascertained. 

responsedelay : integer
Number of days to wait before initiating reactive strategies. A values of -1 would deploy reactive strategies on day 0, the first day of the simulation. this differs from the pre-strategy option because pre-vaccination assumes that you can vaccinate people early enough such that they have full protection on day 0. With a responsedelay of -1, they might get vaccine on day 0. Default is 1. 

responseday : integer
Sets the reactive responses to begin on specified day instead of waiting for ascertained cases (instead of using responsethreshold and responsedelay).

ascertainmentdelay : integer
Number of days it takes medical personnel to ascertain a symptomatic individual. Default is 1 day. 

ascertainmentfraction : real
Fraction of all symptomatic individuals who will be ascertained. Default is 0.8. 

essentialfraction: real
Fraction of working-age adults that belong to the "essential workforce" and are priortized for receiving vaccine. Default is 0, no priority. The essential workforce is 6.9% of the employed population when there is a vaccine shortage and 10.8% if there is not a shortage. Default is 0, no essential workers prioritized to get vaccine.

pregnantfraction : real[5]
Fraction of people in each of the 5 age groups who are pregnant. Default is "0 0 0.02771 0.02069 0". 

highriskfraction : real[5]
Fraction of individuals in each of the 5 age groups who are at high risk of complications from coronavirus. for example, 0.089 0.089 0.212 0.212 0.0 would make 8.9% of children and 21.2% of adults under 65 years high risk. Default is 0, no high risk, for all age groups. 

seedtract : integer[4]
Seeds a single census tract with infected people. State, county, and tract FIPS followed by the number of people to infect. 

seedinfected : integer
Number of people to infect across the whole population. Default is 0, infect no people. 

seedinfecteddaily : binary
Indicates if infected people should be introduced into the population every day or just on the first day. A value of 1 will seed infected people every day, while 0 seeds infected only on day 0. Default is 0. 

seedairports : integer
Value between 0 and 10000 to indicate the number of passengers per 10000 per day to infect in airport counties. Default is 0, no passengers to be infected. 

travel : binary
enable short-term long-distance travel. Value of 1 enables travel, 0 indicates no travel. Default is 0, but should be set to 1 if simulating the continental US.

antiviralpolicy : string
Indicates which persons get antivirals. Can be one of four possible values, none, treatmentonly, or HHTAP (household members all get drugs if one member is ascertained). Default is none. 

schoolclosurepolicy : string
Identify which schools to close. Can take one of three possible values, none, all, or bytractandage. After reactive responses have started, either no schools close (none), all schools close (all) or the schools in a single tract can be closed (bytractand). Default is none.

schoolclosuredays : integer
Number of days to close schools ranging from 0 to the value of runlength. The default is 0, no school closure. A value larger than runlength would close the schools permanently.

schoolopening : integer[56]
School opening day for each state after the start of the simulation. Values of 0 or -1 indicate that the state's schools are open when the simulation starts, while other values indicate that the state's schools start after n days. The parameter takes 56 arguments, which correspond to the FIPS codes of the states. The values are for the states in the following order ("-" indicates that the value is not used):
Alabama, Alaska, -, Arizona, Arkansas, California, -, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, -, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, -, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, -, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming

voluntaryisolation : real
Voluntary isolation compliance probability. This is the probability that a sick person stays home voluntarily one day after symptoms. Default is 0, no isolation.

ascertainedisolation : real
Ascertained isolation compliance probability. This is the probability that a sick person stays after being ascertained. Default is 0, no isolation.

quarantine : real

quarantinelength : integer
Length of household quarantine in days. Default is 14.

liberalleave : real

communitycontactreductiondays : integer
Duration of reduction in community contacts policy in days. Default is 10000.

--------------------------
4. Running corvid

To run Corvid:
  ./corvid config
where config is the name of your configuration file.
The program will print out its version number and any configuration
errors to stdout.

Unless the names of all output files are specified in the configuration
file, Corvid uses a file called "run-number" that is appended to the output
file names. The contents of the file is a single number (e.g., 0) that is
incremented each time Corvid is run. For example, the summary and log files
will be "Summary0" and "Log0" by default. The run-number file is not
included with the Corvid distribution and must be created by the user. This
file, and the desired data files, should be in the same directory as the
executable.


--------------------------
5. Output files

A simulation run will produce 1 to 4 output files, depending on 
configuration parameters. The filenames are a prefix (e.g., "Summary") 
followed by a number, which is taken from the file run-number, unless
the filenames are specified in the configuration file.
All output files are in ascii text format.

Summary(n) - outputs the settings used for the simulation, final attack 
rates, vaccines used, daily totals of symptomatic individuals.
Note that the "Number symptomatic" is the symptomatic prevalence, or the
number of people who are symptomatic on a given day - it is not the
number who become symptomatic that day.

Log(n) - The number of symptomatics per tract each day (prevalence and 
cumulative). Each line has: the day, a unique numeric tract id, the 
number of people currently symptomatic in the 5 age groups, the number 
of people who have ever been symptomatic in the 5 age groups. Can be an
enormous file.

Tracts(n) - a unique numeric tract id, the FIPS codes, and the 
populations of the tracts by age. Also contains the number of people 
who work in this tract (including residents). Comma-separated value 
files with a header row. This is only output when Log files are output.

Individuals(n) - Lists info on all people, with one line per person. 
Comma-separated value files with a header row.  Can be an enormous file.

--------------------------
6. Sample configuration files

config-minimal - A basic configuration file.  Simulates an epidemic with
R_0=1.3 in a single community of 2000 people (using data from "one-*")
with 10 initial infecteds.  Uses a random number seed of "1".

config-seattle26 - Simulates an epidemic with R_0=2.6 in metropolitan
Seattle (using data from "seattle-*") with 2 initial infecteds.  Uses a
random number seed of "1".

config-seattle26-closeallschools - Simulates an epidemic with R_0=2.6 in
metropolitan Seattle (using data from "seattle-*") with 5 initial
infecteds. All schools close on day 60 for 14 days before reopening.
Uses a random number seed of "1".

config-seattle26-isolation - Simulates an epidemic with R_0=2.6 in
metropolitan Seattle (using data from "seattle-*") with 5 initial
infecteds. Voluntary home isolation starts on day 60 with a compliance
of 60%.

config-seattle26-liberalleave - Simulates an epidemic with R_0=2.6 in
metropolitan Seattle (using data from "seattle-*") with 5 initial
infecteds. Workplace liberal leave starts on day 60 with a compliance
of 60%.

config-seattle26-quarantine - Simulates an epidemic with R_0=2.6 in
metropolitan Seattle (using data from "seattle-*") with 5 initial
infecteds. Home quarantine starts on day 60 with a compliance of 60%.

config-seattle26-workfromhome - Simulates an epidemic with R_0=2.6 in
metropolitan Seattle (using data from "seattle-*") with 5 initial
infecteds. 60% of people start working from home instead of going to
work starting on day 60.

config-laiv-vs-tiv - Vaccination of 50% of children enrolled in 
school with two different vaccines in Los Angeles County.  Vaccine "0" 
represents live, attenuated vaccine, which has VE_S=40%, VE_I=50%, and 
VE_P=83% but is not administered to pre-school age children and people 
with asthma (see Basta et al 2008, American Journal of Epidemiology).
Vaccine "1" is a trivalent inactivated vaccine, which has VE_S=40%, 
VE_I=40%, and VE_P=67%, and is given to the remainder of the 
school children. The program distributes the vaccines in order, so 50%
of school-age children are selected to be vaccinated, and the non-
asthmatic ones are pre-vaccinated with Vaccine 0, and then the 
remaining selected children are pre-vaccinated with Vaccine 1. If 
Vaccine 0 had no restrictions on use, then all selected children would 
receive it, and there would be no one left to receive Vaccine 1.
The epidemic with R_0=1.8 is seeded with 9 new infected people each
day.

config-twodose - Reactive mass vaccination of 70% of people in Seattle.
Vaccine requires two doses. The first confers 50% of the final efficacy
after a two-week exponential buildup. The second, which must be given
at least 21 days later, confers the final efficacy after a 7-day 
buildup.

config-highrisk - Pre-vaccination of 100% of high-risk individuals,
essential workers, pregnant women, and people who live with infants.
